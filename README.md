# PositiveIntegerToTreeBijection

The goal for this project is to provide a visual representation of non-zero integers as rooted, unoriented, finite trees 
based on the following:

[Peter Cappello. A New Bijection between Natural Numbers and Rooted Trees. 4th SIAM Conf. on Discrete Mathematics, San Francisco, June 1988.](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~cappello/papers/1988SiamDM.html)

## Running the project:

1. Fork this project.
2. From a terminal window, change directory (cd) into the project's dist directory.
3. Run the command <pre><code>java -jar PositiveIntegerToTreeBijection.jar</code></pre>
